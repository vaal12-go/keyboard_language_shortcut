<h1 id="keyboard-language-shortcut">Keyboard language shortcut</h1>
<p>
  This software is made to allow change of language with direct shortcut (e.g.
  Ctrl-1 for English, Ctrl-2 for Polish) in Windows.
</p>
<p>Windows does have system dialog to set language shortcuts:</p>
<p>
    <!-- src="/documentation/img/Windows_language_shortcuts.png" -->
  <img
    src="documentation/img/Windows_language_shortcuts.png"
    alt="Windows system language shortcut dialog!"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Over the years and many windows version (windows 7, 10) multiple updates to
  windows 10 this option had proven to be unstable (while sequence shortcut
  usually Ctrl-Shift works fine direct shortcuts after several reboots stop
  working and have to be entered again). Hence this application.
</p>
<p>
  Application does not change cycling through languages via standart (usually
  Ctrl-Shift).
</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
  This is a simple application. Download zip file from the releases section of
  github and unzip it somewhere on your computer.
</p>
<p>
  Edit supplied sample languages.conf file (for options see comments in the
  file).
</p>
<p>
  Keyboard languages does not need to be installed separately if they are not
  available - application will load those via Windows API.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish for application to start during windows startup automatically, the
  right press on the application language.
</p>
<p>
  In case application (language) icon is hidden you can force it to be visible
  all the time (see -

  >)
</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>
  Shortcut can be a combination of ctrl, alt, win and shift modifiers and a
  single key (this is limitation of windows API, so cannot be changed).
  Application will be developed to accept multiple keys).

  This is not a stable application. It will not harm your computer, but possible
  bugs may require restart of the application.

<h3 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h3>
<p>
  Only windows (tested on Windows 10) OS is supported. No plans for other
  operating systems. Although the application is in free pascal (which is cross
  platform), application relies heavily on OS specific keyboard APIs, which I
  believe would be hard to port for other OSes.
